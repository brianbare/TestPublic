# Reflect Extensions

## What is the Reflect Extesions package?

This package is a series of both Runtime components and Editor tools developed by Reflect users. These can be used to easily customize and extend Reflect to your needs.

The components and tools are not maintained by the Reflect development team, and therefore come without any garantee that they will be maintained.


## How do I get support for Reflect Extensions?

Reflect Extensions is distributed without any garantee or support. It's meant to inspire and help get started with Unity Reflect.
