  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: This viewer builds on top of the default Reflect viewer by adding a button,
      top menu and controllers to the UI gameobjects in the menu under the Canvas
      gameobject. The following is an overview for getting a custom feature like
      jumping to various camera positions implemented from Revit into your viewer.

    text: 'Create a custom parameter in Revit and assign it to a family like Floors.
      Floors were chosen because in this viewer example, the center top location
      of the imported floor mesh is used and then moved 1.7 meters up. This can be
      changed in the script:'

    text: "The Revit metadata is found at runtime by using the Metadata component
      that will be created on each of the model\u2019s game objects at runtime. You
      can see what this will look like in play mode or by importing your Revit model
      into the project via the Reflect window."
